        "review": "This was the first time I've put a deposit on a car without seeing it and I am very cautious and fussy and being a salesman myself not in to car sales tactics from dealerships, nor do I leave reviews, so this is a first for me. I was sent a walk around video and any information on the history that I required, and I was collected at the train station after a 3.5 hour train ride."

        "review": "Very polite, very patient and not pushy at all and a very respectful person who doesn't give you all the salesman drama and treats you like a person. Customer service was first class, and I recommend carco.uk and especially Amir to anyone looking to buy a good car from a good used car dealership. Well worth the long travel their and back and would use them again."
